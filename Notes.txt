Docker is a technology that provides the ability to containerize environments for running applications in lieu of virtual machines(VMs).

Primary purported advantage is the utilization of resources, specifically operating system(OS) usage. Where VMs requires a spin up of an entire OS and associated resouces, docker containers can share resources/OS of the host machine possibly making for a lighter weight solution versus VMs.

May have issues due to this content being outdated, references to docker-machine being used.
