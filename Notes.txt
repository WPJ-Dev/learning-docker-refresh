Docker is a technology that provides the ability to containerize environments for running applications in lieu of virtual machines(VMs).

Primary purported advantage is the utilization of resources, specifically operating system(OS) usage. Where VMs requires a spin up of an entire OS and associated resouces, docker containers can share resources/OS of the host machine possibly making for a lighter weight solution versus VMs.

May have issues due to this content being outdated, references to docker-machine being used.

Image vs Container: Template vs Instance

`docker`
    ps: list containers

`docker run` 
    -i:(interactive) keeps STDIN(standard input) open 
    -t:(--tty) activate a suo tty 'secure?'
    -d: run container in background and print container ID
    -p: publish a container's port(s) to...
    -v: bind mount a volume--link folders internally and externally

Docker and data
    -v to create a linked volume for persitent storage
    create volume bound to container
        `docker create -v <directory> <name> <type>`
        `docker run -it --volumes-from <bound volume name>....`


Dockerfiles
    - Build instructions that execute build steps

    -`docker build .` builds 'Dockerfile'(standard naming)
        -t: name and optionally tag([name]:[tag])
        -f: name of Dockerfile if not standard

    -FROM: the base image used for build ex.(unbutu 25.10)

    -RUN: 

    -ENTRYPOINT: 
    -CMD: commands to be run

Where to store docker images
    Docker Hub: free if public(1 private repo free?)
    Other registries?: []
